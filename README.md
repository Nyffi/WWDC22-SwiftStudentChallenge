# Kukei Katch (WWDC22 Swift Student Challenge Project)
Kukei Katch is a game for iPad developed using SpriteKit for the WWDC 2022's Swift Student Challenge.

## The Goal
The goal of the project was to show the potential that games have for teaching and training by training the player's reflexes and visuomotor (hand-eye) coordination.
The goal of the game is to tap or swipe all the pink enemies, named Kukei, as soon as they show up. The quicker you are, the more points are awarded.

## About the Author and the Project
Hey there, my name is Paulo César, and I am a Software Engineering student at the Catholic University of Brasilia, and also one of the students at the Developer Academy/UCB, in Brazil.

My desire when creating the idea for this project, was to make a game that recreated the style and gameplay of Flash games that I played when I was a kid, and I also wanted my game to train the player’s reflexes and hand-eye coordination in a non-obvious way.

I believe that games have a huge potential of being used for educational and training purposes, even when that is not the main goal of the game. You can think of any video game in the world, regardless of theme, gameplay or story, they will always teach or train something, the most common being hand-eye coordination.
